      % Send a strobed digital word.
      % @param word unsigned integer representing a word or code to send
      % @param port optional 0-based id indicating from which physical
      % port to send @a word
      % @details
      % Must set the bits of the digital output indicated by @port to
      % match @a word, then set a strobe bit to indicate to an external
      % system that @a word is ready for reading, then clear the strobe
      % bit.
      % @details
      % If @a word is too large to fit within the bits of @a port, must
      % set as many least-significant bits as possible, and must not clip
      % or round @a word.  For example, if @a word is a 16-bit integer
      % and @a port has only 8 bits, must set @a word modulo 2^8, instead
      % of clipping or rounding @a word to 2^8-1.
      % @details
      % If @a port is omitted, or of there is only one physical output
      % port, should treat @a port as 0.
      % @details
      % Must return a positive timestamp, based on the local host's
      % clock, that is the best estimate of when the strobe bit was set,
      % or a negative scalar to indicate an error.

      % @param channel optional 0-based id indicating from which physical
      % channel to send the TTL pulse.
      % @details
      % Must send a standard transistor-transistor-logic(TTL) pulse on
      % the given @a channel.
      % @details
      % A TTL pulse should begin with @a channel already at a low value,
      % within 0.0-0.8V of ground. The @a channel should transition to a
      % high value, within 2.2-5V above ground, for a duration long
      % enough to be detected by an external system.  Then @a channel
      % should transition back to a low value.
      % @details
      % If @a channel is omitted, or of there is only one physical output
      % channel, should treat @a channel as 0.
      % @details

      % @param channel optional 0-based id indicating from which physical
      % channel to send the TTL signal.
      % @param signal logical array specifying a sequence of TTL values
      % to output from @a channel, with true->high and false->low.
      % @param frequency frequency in Hz at which to move through
      % elements of @a signal.
      % @details
      % Must output standard transistor-transistor-logic(TTL) voltages on
      % the given @a channel, according to the given @a signal and @a
      % frequency.  Once output begins, must make every attempt to output
      % all of @a signal withoug timing jitter, for example by buffering
      % @a signal in external hardware.
      % @details
      % Must output each element of @a signal, one at a time, with true
      % elements corresponding to logic high and false elements
      % corresponding to logic low.  Each logic value should persist on
      % @a channel for the 1/@a frequency seconds.  Consecutive high or
      % low otuputs should be continuous, without gaps, so that @a signal
      % may specify a sequence of logic pulses, or a square logic
      % wavform.
      % @details
      % May or may not block in order to complete and/or verify output.
      % If @a signal is too long or @a frequency is unattainable for the
      % given @a channel, should return immediately and return a negative
      % status value.
      % @details
      % If @a channel is omitted, or of there is only one physical output
      % channel, should treat @a channel as 0.
      % @details
      % Must return a positive timestamp, based on the local host's

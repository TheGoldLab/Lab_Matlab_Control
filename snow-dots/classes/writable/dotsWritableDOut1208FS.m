   % @class dotsDOut1208FS
   % Implement digital outputs using mexHID() and the 1208FS USB device.
   % @details
   % dotsDOut1208FS is an implementation of the dotsAllDOutObjects
   % interface for doing digital outputs.  It uses the mexHID() mex
   % function to locate and control the "1208FS" USB device from
   % Measurement Computing.  dotsAllDOutObjects uses only a few features
   % of the 1208FS:
   %   - 15-bit output words, plus one strobe bit, use up both of the
   %   digital ports, A and B.
   %   - TTL pulses and signals may use either analog output port, 0 or 1,
   %   one at atime.
   %   .
   % The description of each interface method contains specific
   % information about which device function and pins it expects to use.
   % @details
   % Since timing is a key part of the dotsAllDOutObjects interface, some
   % general timng considerations for mexHID() and the
   % 1208FS follow.  The description of each interface method contains
   % additional, specific timing considerations.
   % @details
   % <b>mexHID() timing</b>
   % @details
   % mexHID() exposes to Matlab the USB and HID functionality of its host
   % operating system (so far only OS X).  Thus it allows Matlab to
   % exchange data with USB "Human Interface Devices", including the
   % 1208FS.  USB data exchanges are called "transactions", which take
   % place during USB "frames", which are regular chunks of time.  So for
   % mexHID(), timing considerations have the flavor of "During which
   % frame was that command sent?" and "What time did that frame occurr?".
   % mexHID() makes this kind of information available.
   % @details
   % In particular, for each transaction that it initiates, mexHID()
   % returns a pre- and post-transaction frame number, each with its own
   % timetsamp.  The pre-post interval indicates how many frames (usually
   % 2) or seconds it took to carry out a transaction.  Large intervals
   % might indicate a problem.  The post-transaction timestamps tend to
   % align with the discrete USB frame edges.
   % @details
   % For the 1208FS device, each USB frame is 1ms long, and this is the
   % timing precision available for controlling the device and accounting
   % for its behavior (but not for its onboard behavior, see below).
   % @details
   % As an aside, note that learning when a transaction happened is not
   % the same as controlling when it will happen.  Such control is not
   % available from mexHID(), nor is it natural to implement in Matlab.
   % But in many cases, as long as the timing information is accurate, it
   % doesn't matter whether it's "past tense" or "future tense".
   % @details
   % <b>1208FS onboard behavior</b>
   % mexHID() can exchange data and commands with the HID front-end
   % of the 1208FS device.  The device also has an onboard microcontroller
   % and memory with which it can do significant behaviors which are
   % beyond the scope of the HID protocol and normal "human interfaces".
   % @details
   % dotsDOut1208FS uses these onboard behaviors to send TTL signals and
   % pulses with deterministic timing: it sends a sequence of
   % voltage samples to be buffered in the device's memory and tells the
   % microprocessor to output the samples at a regular frequency.  Since
   % the onboard microprocessor is removed from Matlab and its
   % multitasking host opertating system, dotsDOut1208FS expects the
   % samples to be output with deterministic timing.
   % @details
   % Thus, the timestamps returned from dotsDOut1208FS are estimates to
   % the nearest 1ms of when an onboard behavior was initiated.
   % dotsDOut1208FS leaves detailed control of ongoing behaviors up to the
   % device's microprocessor.
   % @details
   % From tests, it appears that the 1208FS could buffer 512 unique
   % voltage samples after whcih it would overwrite older samples.  Thus,
   % dotsDOut1208FS will only attempt to output TTL signals that are this
   % long or shorter.  The span of time over which the device outputs the
   % samples depends on the specified sample frequency, which may range
   % from about 0.5Hz through 10,000Hz.  Note that 10,000Hz is well beyond
   % the realm of 1ms USB frames!

      % too long to fit in the device's onboard memory, returns
      % immediately with a negative error code.  From tests, it appears
      % that the onboard memory holds 512 samples.
      % @details
      % Before outputting a new TTL signal, blocks until the 1208FS
      % deivce reports that the previous signal is all done.  Otherwise,
      % the previous signal would be truncated.  The device reports the
      % status of the previous signal as a HID element value which
      % mexHID() can read.
      % @details
      % Once ready, makes 1 mexHID() transaction to configure the given
      % @a channel to ouput n samples at the given @a frequency, where n
      % is the number of elements in @a signal.  Then makes m additional

      % @details
      % From tests, it appears that the 1208FS begins outputting
      % @a signal upon receipt of one of the m @a signal data
      % transactions.  There are two apparent patterns:
      %   -# when the number of transactions m is 7 or fewer, the
      %   device outputs samples upon receipt of last transaction.
      %   -# when the number of transacitons m is 8 or more, the
      %   device outputs samples upon receipt of 8th transaction.
      %   .
      % Returns the mexHID() pre-transaction timestamp from either the
      % last or the 8th transaction, as above.  From tests, it appears
      % that this pre-transaction timestamp preceeds signal onset by
      % about 3.5ms when the scan @a frequency is 1000Hz and about 1.5ms
      % when the scan @a frequency is 10,000Hz.  The size of the
      % preceeding interval did not seem to depend on the length of @a
      % signal.  Further testing would be warranted.

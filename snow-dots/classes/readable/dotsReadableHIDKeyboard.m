   % @class dotsReadableHIDKeyboard
   % Reads data from a HID keyboard device.
   % @details
   % dotsReadableHIDKeyboard extends the dotsReadableHID superclass to
   % manage HID keyboard devices.  Many integrated and USB keybords are
   % HID keyboards.
   % @details
   % By default, dotsReadableHIDKeyboard defines "pressed" events for
   % each keyboard key.  Use getNextEvent() to make sure that no key
   % presses are missed, and that each press is observed only once.
   %
   % Example usage:
   %  kb = dotsReadableHIDKeyboard();
   %  [isPressed, waitTime, data, kbout] = dotsReadableHIDKeyboard.waitForKeyPress(kb, 'KeyboardF', 5, true)

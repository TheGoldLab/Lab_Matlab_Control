classdef topsConcurrent < topsRunnable
   % @class topsConcurrent
   % Superclass for flow-control classes that may operate concurrently.
   % @details
   % The topsConcurrent superclass provides a common interface for Tower
   % of Psych classes that manage flow control, and may work concurrently
   % with one another.
   % @details
   % In addition to being able to run(), topsConcurrent objects can also
   % runBriefly(), which means to carry out a small part of their normal
   % run() behavior, and then return as soon as possible.  runBriefly()
   % behaviors can be interleaved to acheive concurrent operation of
   % multiple topsConcurrent objects within a single Matlab instance.
   % @details
   % Multiple topsConcurrent objects can be aggregated within a single
   % topsConcurrentComposite object.  This makes allows the aggregated
   % objects to be treated like a single topsRunnable object.

      % @param duration how long in seconds to keep running
      % @details
      % topsConcurrent redefines the run() method of topsRunnable.  It
      % uses start(), finish(), and repeated calls to runBriefly() to
      % accomplish run() behaviors.  By default, run() takes over
      % flow-control from the caller until isRunning becomes false.  If
      % @a duration is provided, runs until isRunning becomes false, or
      % @a duration elapses, then sets isRunning to false.
      function run(self, duration)
         if nargin < 2
            duration = inf;

      % Do a little flow control and return as soon as possible.
      % @details
      % Subclasses should redefine runBriefly() to do specific run()
      % behaviors, a little at a time, and return as soon as possible.

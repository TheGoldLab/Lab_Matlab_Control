# RTDots taskResponse-time, random-dot motion, direction-discrimination task******* GET/UPDATE THE CODE*****1. Get Lab-Matlab-Control from the GoldLab gitHub repository (https://github.com/TheGoldLab/Lab-Matlab-Control)   For now, the code is in a development branch (eyeDev). On our machines, open the Terminal application and type:	   -> cd /Users/Lab/ActiveFiles/Matlab/Lab-Matlab-Control	   -> git pull origin eyeDev2. Install dependencies   a. QUEST: https://github.com/BrainardLab/mQUESTPlus   b. CLIENT/SERVER COMMUNICATION (for remote graphics): https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/345-tcp-udp-ip-toolbox-2-0-6******* ON THE SERVER (the Mac Mini in our setup)*****1. Start Matlab server	a. type: 		-> RTDserver	b. To force quit when the screen is blank (will have to re-start Matlab):		<Command>-<Option>-<Esc>	c. To force quit script when the command window is available:		<Ctrl>-c******* ON THE CLIENT (the laptop in our setup)*****1. Start Pupil labs. 	a. Make sure the glasses are plugged into the USB port		b. Open terminal app and at the prompt type (hitting <return> after each line):		-> cd /Users/Lab/ActiveFiles/PupilLabs/pupil/pupil_src		-> python3 main.py		c. Three windows should open up, labeled:		Pupil Capture - World		Pupil Capture - Eye 0		Pupil Capture - Eye 1	      If the "World" window does not open, try quitting terminal then trying again. If one or both of the Eye windows does not open, go to the World window, click on the â€œGeneral Settingsâ€ button on the upper-right corner, and make sure â€œDirect eye 0â€ and â€œDirect eye 1â€ both have greenish buttons next to them (if not, click on the button).   d. Make sure calibration (the "bullseye"icon to the right) is set to Manual Marker Calibration.2. Start Matlab client	a. type: 		-> RTDrun	b. To force quit when the screen is blank (will have to re-start Matlab):		<Command>-<Option>-<Esc>	c. To force quit script when the command window is available:		<Ctrl>-c   d. During an experiment, you can use the keyboard BETWEEN TRIALS for the following commands (single character keypress):         q: quit the experiment         p: pause the experiment ('d' to continue; i.e., "done" with pause)         t: skip the rest of this task and start the next task         c: re-calibrate the eye tracker******* DATA FILES*****1. There are two data files created:   a. the topsDataLog file: <name>.mat   b. the pupilLabs file: <name>_pupilLabs.mat   Default path and filenames are in RTDconfigure.   The default filename has the form:      data_YYYY_MM_DD_HH_NN      where       YYYY = four-digit year      MM   = two-digit month      DD   = two-digit day      HH   = two-digit hour      NN   = two-digit minute2.

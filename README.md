# Lab-Matlab-Control
Custom utilities for experimental control for the Gold Lab

## What you need:
- The files contained within Lab-Matlab-Control and Lab-Matlab-Utilities
- MGL. Which can be downloaded from this link: http://gru.stanford.edu/doku.php/mgl/overview
- PsychToolbox: http://psychtoolbox.org

- It's important to note that the lastest version of Matlab that Snow-Dots will work 100% properly on is 2013a. With the exception of dotsDrawableExplosions, Matlab 2016a will run everything as well. Currently Matlab 2017a is not compatabile with Snow Dots. If you must install the 2013a version of Matlab and are running on Apples latest OS, you will likely encouter an error when trying to run it. Please go to this link https://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/1098655 and complete the appropriate steps to patch up your 2013a version of Matlab.
